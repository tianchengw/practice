    "A combination lock has W wheels, each of which has the integer values 1 through N on it, in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any moment, each wheel shows a specific value on it. Xi is the initial value shown on the i-th wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a single move to change a wheel from showing the value X to showing either X+1 or X-1, wrapping around between 1 and N. For example, if a wheel currently shows the value 1, in one move you can change its value to 2 or N.\n",

    "Input\n",
    "The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.\n",
